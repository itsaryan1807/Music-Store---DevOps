# Music-Store---DevOps

Quick start

- Open the demo in your browser:
  - Double-click `Index.html` in the project folder.
  - Or (recommended) serve with a simple HTTP server and open the URL:


What’s included

- `Index.html` — single HTML file with Home and Cart views.
- `css/styles.css` — styling for the demo.
- `js/script.js` — minimal product list and cart logic (uses `localStorage`).

Notes

- This is a front-end demo; there is no backend. Cart data is stored locally in the browser.
- Checkout is a demo action that clears the cart.

Want changes? I can add images, search, or package this as a small static site.
